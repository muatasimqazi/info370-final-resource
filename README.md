# Project Proposal

## Project Description

* What is the overarching purpose of your research project, and why is it an important undertaking?
* How does your research fit into the broader problem domain? You should cite at least 3 papers that help contextualize your research. 
* What specific hypothesis (hypotheses) are you going to test?
* What are the datasets you'll be working with to answer this question? Please include relevant background describing the datasets you identify.

    To answer this question, we will be working on a dataset about cardiovascular disease [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) that consists of 70,000 records of patients data. We were particularly interested in exploring a research question in the domain of healthcare. We wanted to understand the relationship between some given factors that contribute to a certain disease. Our search led us to this dataset and had all the relevant information that we could use to predict cardiovascular disease. According to Center for Disease Control and Prevention, “heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women.” In 2015, more than half of these deaths were men. The main risk factors for cardiovascular disease are high blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking. CDC also lists some medical conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, and lifestyle choices, such as poor diet, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol use, as being the common risk factors. Our dataset includes data for most of these risk factors.
* What statistical and machine learning methods do you plan on using to test your hypothesis?
* Who is your target audience for the resource you will build? Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.

    There could be numerous target audiences for our resource since healthcare topics are of interest to almost everyone. Our resource will be useful for particularly people affiliated with healthcare as well as individuals who want to prevent cardiovascular disease or want to learn more about it. For the former, the resource can provide useful insights as what specific risk factors are of more importance than the others. In addition, the resource can help them predict whether a patient could have cardiovascular disease based on the variables of risk factors we will be exploring as part of this project. For common individuals, the resource can provide useful information on which risk factors to pay heed to based on their significance in the outcome.

* What should your audience learn from your resource? Consider specific questions they may want to answer.

    Professionals from the healthcare industry could learn what risks factors are bigger contributors to cardiovascular disease. They could get specific insights from the resource that otherwise would not be possible just based on looking at the data of a particular patient. A question that they could get an answer for from our resource would be what specific suggestions they should make to an individual patient based on what the model predicts so that they could get that particular risk factor under control.
